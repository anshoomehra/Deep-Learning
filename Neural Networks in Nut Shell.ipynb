    "\n",
    "So we talked about error rate briefly above. However, we did not apply error rate in our calculation yet, which we wil do now, however, before we do so, the error rate must be **continous** in nature, i.e every iteration should tell us whether we are getting closer to our goal or heading father .. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is good segue to introduce **Log Loss Error Method**. This method introduce penalty to every point or input data, points already in right classified zones have least penalty and points classified in wrong zones have highest penalties, so at every epoch, we access total error, with goal to minimize or completely eliminate the error. \n",

    "### Multi-Class Solution using Softmax Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go see how to write Softmax, let's see why we have to use this. So we studied about continuous perdictions using Sigmoid Function but that solution work well if we have one class as an output and subsequent probalities, what if we have more than one class as an output. Well we do have scores which are higher for respectives classes however to derive accurate probablities we will have to normalize scores, example : if we are predicting  breeds of Dog, with output as Golden Retreiver, German Shepherd, Autralian Shepherd and our equation produce scores like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden Retreiver = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "German Shepherd = 1\n",

    "Autralian Shepherd = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "we can normalize as 2/(2+1+0), 1/(2+1+0), 0/(2+1+0)\n",
    "\n",
    "however there is one major issues, what if one of the scores is negative, which is plausible, this may turn divisor to zero, and in turn probability to infinity which does not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea is good though, to solve this, one can make use of  exponential function, as the result of that is always positive, so if we apply this our normalization equation, we get something line this ..\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax Function = e(Xi) / ( e(Xi) +..+ e(Xn) )\n",

Now that we're using a lot of data, summing up all the weight steps can lead to really large updates that make the gradient descent diverge. To compensate for this, you'd need to use a quite small learning rate. Instead, we can just divide by the number of records in our data, mm to take the average. This way, no matter how much data we use, our learning rates will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001.

So, we'll initialize the weights from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good value for the scale is 1/$\\sqrt{n}$ where nn is the number of input units. This keeps the input to the sigmoid low for increasing numbers of input units.\n",

    "You might think there will be three input units, but we actually need to transform the data first. The rank feature is categorical, the numbers don't encode any sort of relative values. Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2. Instead, we need to use dummy variables to encode rank, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros. Rows with rank 1 have one in the rank 1 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. Rows with rank 2 have one in the rank 2 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. And so on.\n",

    "We'll also need to standardize the GRE and GPA data, which means to scale the values such they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because the sigmoid function squashes really small and really large inputs. The gradient of really small and large inputs is zero, which means that the gradient descent step will go to zero too. Since the GRE and GPA values are fairly large, we have to be really careful about how we initialize the weights or the gradient descent steps will die off and the network won't train. Instead, if we standardize the data, we can initialize the weights easily and everyone is happy.\n",

    "**1. Overfitting (High Variance) **- Overfitting is the state when model errors rate is very low on training set, but it does not perform very well on generic data set, i.e. we have trained our model too much specific to a dataset. Example, we are able to classify dogs in brown, white furs, ut any other color of dogs are misclassified. This is also indication that our model is too complex with many layers ..\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2. Underfitting (High Bias) **- Underfitting is the state when trained model is too loose or not trained enough, or way too generic in nature, or training error and testing errors are high. It is able to classify but with lot of mistakes & ignoring subtle boundaries which provides relevance to the subject.\n",

    "\n",
    ">>**1. Early Stopping ( for Under and Overfitting both ) **\n",
    "So what is the right state?? It is not an easy answer, one way one can perceive the optimal state but observing errors between **traning and test data**, so far we did not talk about training abd test data, we just refered data as input data. What we do is split input data to 2 buckets called training and test, we use training data to train the model, model never see the test data. Once we are happy with state that trainin is optimal we use the optimized model on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>With clarity on what test and training data buckets are: Below diagram show observations on these for n number of epochs, we can see that state which is referred as just right, has test data error reached to a minimum point called **Goldilocks Spot** and start to increase from there, this is point we start to tend towards overfitting, i.e. spots generalizing and starts memorizing.\n",

It is also good for feature selection, sometimes we have hundreds of features, and with L1 technique we can select the ones whcih are important & turn rest in to zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>**L2 Regularization ** on the other hand, tends not to favor sparse veactors since it tries to maintain all the weights homogeneously small. This one normally gives better results for training models so it's the one we will use the most.\n",

The reasoning behind this is that there are nodes with heavy weights, and they start to influence outcome of the network, when we drop each nodes in this manner, every node get fair share to influence the outcome. What we do is define probability like 20%, which means each node gets dropped 20% of the time. \n",

Another way  to see ouput is between x & xero. This function is used a lot instead of sigmoid, as it can dramatically improve the performace of the network without sacrificing much accuracy. Since it's derivative is 1 for positive numbers. It is fascinating that this function which barely breaks linearilty can lead to such complex non-linear solutions.\n",

Having said this, it will drift us away from the Global Minimum a bit but not that much --- theoritically it seems vague on why this would work to get us over local minimum and why not global minimum but in practice it works pretty well.\n",

    "\n",
    ">A potential confusion is the following: How do we know if we should use the mean or the total squared (or absolute) error?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The good news is, it doesn't really matter. As we can see, the total squared error is just a multiple of the mean squared error, since\n",

    ">Therefore, since derivatives are linear functions, the gradient of T is also m m times the gradient of M.\n",

    ">In real life, we'll have algorithms that will help us determine a good learning rate to work with. Therefore, if we use the mean error or the total error, the algorithm will just end up picking a different learning rate.\n",

    "\n",
    ">  ** 2. Batch vs Stochastic Gradient Descent vs Mini-Batch Gradient Descent??? **\n",
    "\n",
    ">At this point, it seems that we've seen two ways of doing linear regression.\n",

    ">By applying the squared (or absolute) trick at every point in our data one by one, and repeating this process many times.\n",
    "By applying the squared (or absolute) trick at every point in our data all at the same time, and repeating this process many times.\n",
    "More specifically, the squared (or absolute) trick, when applied to a point, gives us some values to add to the weights of the model. We can add these values, update our weights, and then apply the squared (or absolute) trick on the next point. Or we can calculate these values for all the points, add them, and then update the weights with the sum of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The latter is called batch gradient descent. The former is called stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bs.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    ">The question is, which one is used in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Actually, in most cases, neither. Think about this: If your data is huge, both are a bit slow, computationally. The best way to do linear regression, is to split your data into many small batches. Each batch, with roughly the same number of points. Then, use each batch to update your weights. This is still called mini-batch gradient descent.\n",

    ">There is no clear answer but both have one distinct difference. If we look at scenario below, MAE has no change with line movement but MSE has clear distinction on which line has lowest error rate. MSE will have edge drawing the most optimal line, though it is subjective that every case may not demand the same.\n",

    "Error Function would go under slight change, we will use MSE or MAE what we learned in regression, once we couple this with Backprop, we will be able to train our network as classification !!\n",
