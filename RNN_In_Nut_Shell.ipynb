    "The neural network architectures you've seen so far were trained using the current inputs only. We did not consider previous(also known as **temporal**) inputs when generating the current output. In other words, our systems did not have any **memory** elements. RNNs address this very basic and important issue by using **memory** (i.e. past inputs to the network) when producing the current output.\n",

    "** RECURRENT ** - Occuring often or reapeatedly\n",

    "## Before we go deep, let's study bit of history of how RNN evolved ..\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first wave of **FFNN (Feed Forward Neural Networks) in 1980s**, it was clear that they have limilation as they are unable to handle temporal dependencies, which as we mentioned above that dependecies which change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnn2.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "** Modeling temporal data is critical in most real-world applications, since natural signals like speech and video have time variant properties & are characterized by having dependencies across time. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Btw, Biologocal Neural Networks have recurring connections, hence, applying to recurrence to artificial feedfoward neural networks made natural sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Attempt** to add memory to Neural Networks were the **Time Delay Neural Networks, TDNNs in short **. In TDNNS, inputs from past timesteps were introduced to the Neural Input, changing the actual external inputs. This had the advantage to have network look beyond current time step, but also introduced the clear disadvantage, since the temporal dependecies were limited to the window of time chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnn3.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "** Simple RNN & ELMON NETWORK (1990)** were next to follow..  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnn4.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It was recognised that all these networks in early 90s were suffered from what we call, ** Vanishing Gradient problem **, in which contributions of information decayed geometrically over time.. Hence,\n",
    "capturing relationships that spanned more than eight or ten steps back was practically impossible.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnn6.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The novelty in LSTMs was the idea that some , what we called state variables, can be kept fixed using gates & re-introduced or not at an appropriate time in future. In this way, arbitraty time intervals can be represented, and temporal dependencies can be captured.\n",
